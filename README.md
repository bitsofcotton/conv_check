# Konbu Check
Get feasible point from multiple linear constraints.

This program aims to check and gain the solvee from multiple set of linear constraints in O(mn^2) arithmetic and elementary function operations.
C++ is needed, and to calculate faster, Eigen library is needed, and to calculate more accurate (N.B. in the most case we need), we may need a gmp library, a mpfr library and a mpfr++ library, or, with certain accuracy calculation, we need a QD library.
For older information, please refer http://sourceforge.net/projects/convcheck/ .  

Actually freezed.

# Tips
The shown string after 'err_error' or 'intercept' is the value depends on the problem and accuracy.
If the value >> 0 (especially >= 1), it is hard to solve in the accuracy.
If feasible region of the original problem is too tight, there's a possibility fails to get feasible point.
If then, please extend little more feasible region by changing threshold_loop parameter.  
And, largest_intercept can be tiny value for the problem with medium accuracy, so please configure this first.  
Include guard definition this uses seems high probability to conflict, please patch before to use.

# Bugs
If the accuracy or parameter configuration is not valid for the problem to be solved, the feasibility that
this program checks will be bugly, If a original problem is good scaled and extended little, it rarely happens.  
And, when we're gaining optimal value, in the parameter initialize function, we assume the largest ratio of
optimal value and variable upper (lower) bound. So if we gained seems to be not optimal, please configure the parameters.

# Parameters
We shall configure the parameters in LP<T>::LP() in konbu.hh.
* threshold_feas   : QR decomposition errors.
* threshold_p0     : each loop P matrix errors.
* threshold_loop   : [-b+1&epsilon;,P][t,x]&leq;b, &epsilon;
* threshold_inner  : each loop checking inner or not.
* largest_intercept: box constraints that Ax&leq;b fix, not Ax&geq;b.
* largest_opt      : assuming optimal value max ratio.
* n_opt_steps      : number of loops to find optimal values.

# Context
Japanese Patent Draft : JP2014089683 . 

# Status
Waiting g++ or clang++ for compatible with OpenACC with iris chips.

# How to install
Please rewrite Makefile as the libraries enabled.
There's -DACC_GMP=$bits option or -DACC_QD_QDOUBLE option or -DACC_DOUBLE option, -DWITHOUT_EIGEN option, and compiler options such like -fopenmp, -pg, -I$where_eigen_lives, ...

# Demos
https://services.limpid-intensity.info/konbu.php is a working sample.

# Proof
Ax&lt;=b

[-b,P][t,x']&lt;=0,
P is part of orthogonal matrix.

[-b'+1&epsilon;,P][t,x'+b'']&lt;=1&epsilon;,
b' is orthogonal to P.

After loop we get :
P'[Q[t,x'',0]]&lt;=0

And when loop, the intercept added is remains, but it is fixed in the last.
So we gain P^t z_0 with fixed intercept.

# Usage
    // if you need, please scope with namespace block, but include guard may harms.
    #include "konbu_init.h"
    ...
    // if you use with mpfr, num_t::set_default_proc(BITS); is needed.
    // if you use with QD,   unsigned int old_cw; fpu_fix_start(&old_cw); is needed.
    ...
    int m; // number of rows;
    int n; // number of columns;
    Mat A(m, n);
    ...
    Vec result;
    bool fix_partial[A.rows()];
    LP<num_t> lp;
    bool feas = lp.inner(fix_partial, result, A, b);
    // if you use with QD,    fpu_fix_end(&old_cw); is needed.

# Little Tips
You can also use this program for pattern matching (finding smaller co-space âˆž-norm) of Rn to Rn+m function, or, for finding possible solvees of PDEs (with 2013 memo last stage), (even if it is not only one solvee because of restrict equations # but if so, solvee we get in this shall not be useful, region or shape or rank will be useful).
If we are using 32 bit machine, it is limitted that we can solve the problem smaller than around 8k x 4k matrix (because of index type is integer, in fact, if we're using 8 bytes floating point number, and like most implementation pointer 1 bit for system, and matrix copy on the memory.).  
If, we run this program with over mn core MPUs, we can gain inner vector in O(n) time order.  
And, if we can fix all in once the inner vector instead of fixing one by one, it's O(lg(n)*lg(mn)) time order but is seems not.
